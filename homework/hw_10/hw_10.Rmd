Linear Models

____________________________________________________

Part1: Using the diamonds dataset, create a linear model of price as a function of the weight of the diamond (carat).
```{r}
library(tidyverse)


carrot_weight_mod <- lm(price ~ carat, data = diamonds)

cost_1carrot <- carrot_weight_mod$coefficients[2]*1 + carrot_weight_mod$coefficients[1]
print(paste0("The cost of one carrot is estimated at $", round(cost_1carrot, digits = 2)))

```
Part 2: Now create a linear model of price as a function of carat and color.
What difference does it make if you convert color to a character vector before you make the model? Note that this is probably what you want to do in general, unless you really know what youâ€™re doing.

model without converion to character first
```{r}
lm(price ~ color, data = diamonds)


```

After conversion to character

```{r}
ch.color <- as.character(diamonds$color)
lm(price ~ ch.color, data = diamonds)

```
The linear regressions change significantly when not converted to a character. This is likely due to the color being stored as a factor, changing the calculation

```{r}

```
